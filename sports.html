Youth career
Cristiano Ronaldo dos Santos Aveiro was born on 5 February 1985 in the São Pedro parish of Funchal, the capital of the Portuguese island of Madeira, and grew up in the nearby parish of Santo António.[9][10] He is the fourth and youngest child of Maria Dolores dos Santos Viveiros Aveiro, who worked as a cook in the hospitality industry and a cleaning woman,[11][12] and José Dinis Aveiro, a municipal gardener at the Junta de Freguesia of Santo António and part-time kit man for football club Andorinha.[13][14][15] His great-grandmother on his father's side, Isabel da Piedade, an African woman, was born in the island of São Vicente, in what was then Portuguese Cape Verde, and moved to Madeira Island at 16.[16][17] He has one older brother, Hugo, and two older sisters, Elma and Liliana Cátia "Kátia".[2] He was named after actor and U.S. President Ronald Reagan, whom his father was a fan of.[18] His mother revealed that she wanted to abort him due to poverty, his father's alcoholism, and having too many children already, but her doctor refused to perform the procedure.[19][20] Ronaldo grew up in an impoverished Catholic home, sharing a room with all his siblings.[21]

As a child, Ronaldo played for Andorinha from 1992 to 1995,[22] where his father was the kit man,[13] and later spent two years with Nacional. In 1997, aged 12, he went on a three-day trial with Sporting CP, who signed him for a fee of £1,500.[23] He subsequently moved from Madeira to Lisbon to join Sporting CP's youth system.[23] By age 14, while struggling with his school duties and responsibilities in Escola EB2 de Telheiras, his school in the Telheiras area of Lisbon, Ronaldo believed he had the ability to play semi-professionally and agreed with his mother and his tutor at Sporting CP, Leonel Pontes,[24] to cease his education to focus entirely on football.[25][26] With a troubled life as a student,[27] and although living in Lisbon area away from his Madeiran family,[28][29] he did not complete schooling beyond the 6th grade.[30][31] While popular with other students at school, he had been expelled after throwing a chair at his teacher, who he said had "disrespected" him.[25] One year later, he was diagnosed with tachycardia, a condition that could have forced him to give up playing football.[32] Ronaldo underwent heart surgery where a laser was used to cauterise multiple cardiac pathways into one, altering his resting heart rate.[33] He was discharged from the hospital hours after the procedure and resumed training a few days later.[34] In 2021, Cristiano Ronaldo's mother, Dolores Aveiro, stated in an interview for Sporting CP's official television channel (Sporting TV) that her son would be a bricklayer if he had not become a professional football player.[35]

vteRonaldo made his debut as a substitute in a 4–0 home win over Bolton Wanderers in the Premier League on 16 August 2003.[50] His performance earned praise from Best, who hailed it as "undoubtedly the most exciting debut" he had ever seen.[43] Ronaldo scored his first goal for Manchester United with a free-kick in a 3–0 win over Portsmouth on 1 November.[51] On 15 May 2004, in a victory against Aston Villa, Ronaldo scored the opening goal and later received the first red card of his career.[52][53] Ronaldo ended his first season in English football with a trophy, scoring the opening goal in United's 3–0 win over Millwall in the 2004 FA Cup Final.[54] BBC pundit Alan Hansen described him as the star of the final.[55] The British press had been critical of Ronaldo during the season for his "elaborate" step-overs in trying to beat opponents,[56] but teammate Gary Neville said he was "not a show pony, but the real thing", and predicted he would become a world-class player.[57]

"He has got the tricks and party pieces, we know that, but they're not much good unless there is something at the end of it all. We still have to remember, of course, that the lad is only 19 years of age. Considering that, you have to say he has got massive talent. His feet are mesmerising at times, and if he can couple that with some consistently good crossing, the future looks frightening."

—Former BBC pundit Alan Hansen commenting on Ronaldo after his first season.[55]
At the start of 2005, Ronaldo played two of his best matches of the 2004–05 season, producing a goal and an assist against Aston Villa and scoring twice against rivals Arsenal.[58][59] Ronaldo won his second trophy in English football, the Football League Cup, after scoring the third goal in United's 4–0 final win over Wigan Athletic.[60]

During his third season in England, Ronaldo was involved in several incidents. Ronaldo clashed with a teammate, striker Ruud van Nistelrooy, who took offence at the winger's showboating style of play.[61] Following the 2006 FIFA World Cup, in which he was involved in an incident where club teammate Wayne Rooney was sent off,[62] Ronaldo publicly asked for a transfer, lamenting the lack of support he felt he had received from the club over the incident.[63] United denied the possibility of him leaving the club.[64] Although his World Cup altercation with Rooney resulted in Ronaldo being booed throughout the 2006–07 season,[65] it proved to be his break-out year, as he broke the 20-goal barrier for the first time and won his first Premier League title.[66]
